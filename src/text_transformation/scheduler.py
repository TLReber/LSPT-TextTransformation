    API: 
        /transform(POST): takes in a description of the data, the
        applied transformations to apply and targets to post the
        transformations to. If there are no targets, then the transformation

        app(web.Application): helper tool to setup http request system
        name(str): string identifier unique across processes
        results(dict): key of unique work request id, value of future
        request_id(int): used to assign unique ids for results
        listen_thread(Thread): runs self.listen in background to make
