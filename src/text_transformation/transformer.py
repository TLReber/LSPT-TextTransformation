class Transformer:
    """
    Handles transformation of input data to output. Changes based on
    type of string given during initialization regular expression specified.
    Follows a state design pattern: wraps functions defined below to accomplish 
    this

    Attributes:
        transformations(list): list of tuples where first item is the string
            expression of a transformation and the value is a function. This 
            attribute is a class attribute
        func((*args, **kwargs)->object): function that was chosen based on
            input type

    Raises:
        ValueError: function not found from name provided

    Examples:
        titleTransform = Transformer("title")
        titleTransform(true, soup instance with "<title>hello</title>") #returns "hello"
        ngramTransform = Transformer("ngrams")
