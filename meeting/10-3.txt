Verification:
- test

Quality Metrics:
- Feasibility: google did it so it is possible, but in our time frame? Yes still
especially with the help of third party libraries & python & teamwork!
- Completness: are all the requirements met?
- Correctness: Need to define what is a correctly transformed document, and what
is a documents title?
- Consistency: Same page parsed, same stuff back
- Verifiability:  coverage, white box testing, black box testing, unit testing


Challenges: 
- page cleaning (dealing with extraneous html)
    - look for python libraries involving html
- defining preprocessing steps
- keep up with D&D data stream (efficiency)
