9/23/19 meeting

goldschmidt put up some questions, not sure if we answered all of them but we
answered the bulk of them:

Trying to build:
----------------
program that takes in a raw string from crawlers and spits out various 
statistics, derive meaning from html


How do we know it will work?
----------------------------
Documents we evaulate and test for what we expect

How do we know it will scale up?
--------------------------------
Keep simple, set up for paralleization

Ethics
------
How we translate and parse is unbiased, don't get stats on inappropriate/
irrelevant
